https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/
-------------------------------------------------------

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

Note:

    The linked list will have at least two elements.
    All of the nodes' values will be unique.
    The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
    Do not return anything from your function.
