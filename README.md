# LeetCodeJava

Leetcode has always helped me learn and practice Data-Structures, Algorithms and various other concepts involved in computer science(majorly prograamming). I plan to solve atleast 5 problems everyday( i.e. at least 5 days a week ) and add the solutions to this repo. Feel free to contribute/suggest any amends in this repo/solutions.

## Project Structure

I have divided the project into 3 different packages:

- com.easy
- com.medium
- com.hard

## About the solutions

* All the problems are solved in Java. I will happy to listen to any suggestions on my solutions. 
* The class names are the actual leetcode problem name. I have also added a link to the actual problem as a comment in each solution

Happy learning! :smile:
